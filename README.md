## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have ZERO-backend running first. You can clone it from [ZERO-backend](https://github.com/LegendaryPark/zero-back-end).

#### ZERO-Frontend

To fully utilize the AI Interview Application, you need to set up the frontend server as well.

1. **Clone the frontend repository**

   Clone the frontend repository from GitHub to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LegendaryPark/zero-front-end.git
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**

   Install the necessary dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Starting the app

To start the frontend application in development mode, run:

Ensure the frontend server is running to handle requests from the frontend application. By default, the frontend server might run on a different port, such as `http://localhost:5173`.
